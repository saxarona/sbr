"""Calcudoku Light

A01170065 - Xavier SÃ¡nchez
A01299000 - Erim Sezer

The Calcudoku Light is described as a CSP:
- Each cell is a variable.
- The domain of each variable (cell) is {1, 2 , 3, 4}.
- Variables have different constraints, explained below.

Constraints:
- Each value should appear only once per column.
- Each value should appear only once per row.
- Each cell is restricted to the values that yield
the goal for each group.


Using the program:
Simply change the CHALLENGE constant from 1 to 4 and run it.
A list of {variables: value} will be printed as the solution.

Additional inline comments are presented in the code
that further detail specific parts of the program.
