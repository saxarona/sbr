This is the Othello (Reversi) game.
This implementation needs to run alpha_beta_search function from
the games module.

The board of the game is a dictionary that maps a cell (x,y)
to its player: {(x,y) : Player}, where Player is WHITE or BLACK.

This needs to be saved in a namedtuple called GameState:

>>> GameState(to_move, utility, board, moves)

to_move is the player whose turn it is now.
utility is a cached utility.
board is the board as a dictionary.
moves is a list of actions.

When checking neighborhoods, the following rules are followed:
If a cell is in (x,y), then:
- N is (x, y-1)
- NE is (x+1, y-1)
- E is (x+1, y)
- SE is (x+1, y+1)
- S is (x, y+1)
- SW is (x-1, y+1)
- W is (x-1, y)
- NW is (x-1, y-1)

The heuristic function was calculated as:

h = my_pieces + my_moves + 3 * my_gains - dangerous_places * my_losses / 2

Where:
- my_pieces is the number of pieces I got on the board now.
- my_moves is number of available moves I've got for my next turn.
- my_gains is the number of pieces converted to my color after my best move,
multiplied by 3.
- dangerous_places are number of valid, empty spaces next to my pieces.
- my_losses is an estimate of the worst case scenario for my opponent's next turn.

dangerous_places is multiplied by my_losses, and then divided by 2 in order
to get the average, like "how dangerous is my next opponent's move".

Many helper functions were created in order to ease up the search of
available moves. For example, we include functions to look for neighbors,
to decode strings to directions, and get the direction from a cell to another.
Some of these functions have a prediction mode used for the calculation of utilities.
