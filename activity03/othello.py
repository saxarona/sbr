This is the Othello (Reversi) game.
This implementation needs to run alpha_beta_search function from
the games module.

We use the same convention used in AIMA:
- actions in lowercase.
- states in UPPERCASE.

We need some basic stuff for the game to work:
- The state as a string, like 'A'.
- The actions in a LIST.

The available MINIMAX tree is a dictionary of dictionaries:
each state is a dictionary that maps actions (keys) to states (values).
Since this is a map inside a map, a useful way to get to the actions
can be seen in the Fig52Game class, in the games module:

>>> list(mydict.get(state, {}).keys())

This will get all keys (actions) of a state, or get an empty dictionary
if state has no available actions.

The utilities of all states can be stored in another dictionary
that maps states to its utility.

The board of the game is a dictionary that maps a cell (x,y)
to its player: {(x,y) : Player}, where Player is WHITE or BLACK.

This needs to be saved in a namedtuple called GameState:

>>> GameState(to_move, utility, board, moves)

to_move is the player whose turn it is now.
utility is a cached utility.
board is the board as a dictionary.
moves is a list of actions.

When checking neighborhoods, the following rules are followed:
If a cell is in (x,y), then:
- N is (x, y-1)
- NE is (x+1, y-1)
- E is (x+1, y)
- SE is (x+1, y+1)
- S is (x, y+1)
- SW is (x-1, y+1)
- W is (x-1, y)
- NW is (x-1, y-1)
