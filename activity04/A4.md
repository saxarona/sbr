# Activity 4

## Ant System

We saw *ACO* as an algorithm to solve **TSPs**. However, we now need it to solve **Knapsacks**, I guess. With 15^4 items. How are we doing it, then?

The function we need to minimize is actually a 4-variable function, namely (in Python-friendly syntax):

````python
f = a0 / x ** 2 + a1 * math.e ** (a2 / x) + a3 math.sin(x)`
sum = 0
for i in data:
	sum = sum + abs(data[i][i] - f(data[i][0], a1, a2, a3, a4, a5))
````

Where `data` is a list of (x,y) coordinates (provided).

Man, this will be haaaaard...
