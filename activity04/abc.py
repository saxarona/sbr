The basic algorithm proposed by Karaboga in 2005 is something like this:

1. Initialize n scout bees with a random search and evaluate their aptitude.
2. Select m best sites for a neighbor-search.
3. Select e sites for elite patches, such that e < m.
4. Select m - e sites for normal patches.
5. Determine patch-size, usually denoted as ngh.
6. Repeat until max_iterations:
7. Create bees for the patches:
    - some for elite patches
    - some_more for normal patches, such that some > some_more
8. Select bee with best evaluation for each patch.
9. Asign n - m bees to randomly search again.
10. Select bee with best evaluation this iteration, and GOTO 6.
