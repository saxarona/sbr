The basic algorithm goes something like this:

1. Initialize:
    a) Set time counter to 0
    b) Set cycles counter (NC) to 0
    c) For every edge (i,j) set an initial value of trail
    d) Place m ants on the n nodes
2. Set tabu list for all ants (or allowed moves, we'll see)
3. Repeat until tabu list is full (or allowed is empty):
    a) For all ants:
        a1) Choose the town j to move to, with calculated
        probability.
        a2) Move the ant to town j.
        a3) Update tabu list accordingly
4. For all ants:
    a) Evaluate performance.
    b) Update shortest tour found.
    c) For every edge (i,j):
        c1) For all ants:
            c1.1) Update pheromone trail
5. For every edge (i,j) compute pheromone trails
6. If cycles counter < max cycles counter and there's no stagnation:
    a) then
        a1) Empty all tabu lists (or re-fill)
        a2) Go back to step 2
    b) else
        b1) Print shortest tour
        b2) Stop
