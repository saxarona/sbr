Particle Swarm Optimization is based on ducks flying.
Each duck has a velocity, and also remembers its best position.
Also, each duck has a neighborhood, and knows the best
neighborhood position.

These three components are combined to obtain the direction
which the duck shall follow.
In the end, all ducks will move near the best spot.

The code is pretty straight-forward, like most metaheuristics.
Instead of using particles, we'll be using ducks:

1. Initialize ducks
2. For each duck:
    - Calculate its evaluation
    - If its evaluation is best than his best, then update.
3. Choose duck with best evaluation as gbest
4. For each duck:
    - Calculate new velocity with eq. (a)
    - Calculate new position with eq. (b)
5. GOTO 2
6. Repeat while iterations < max_iterations

These are the equations:

Eq. (a):
duck.vel = c0 * duck.vel +
           c1 * rand() * (duck.pbest - duck.pos) +
           c2 * rand() * (duck.gbest - duck.pos)

Eq. (b):
duck.pos = duck.pos + duck.vel
